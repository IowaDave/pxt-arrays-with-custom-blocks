# Examples of Custom Blocks Using Arrays
MakeCode projects having custom blocks that either accept arrays as parameters or return arrays.

Each project folder contains:
* code for the custom.ts file of the project
* code for the main.ts file that demonstrates using the custom blocks
* a link to download the MakeCode editor from microbit.org, containing the complete project
