# Worm
A MakeCode project with a custom block that receives, modifies, and returns an array-of-arrays.

It simulates a four-segment worm moving randomly around on the LED display of a micro:bit. We like the way Wormy shimmers when it starts chasing its tail around a little square. But pretty soon it moves on.

Place the code from custom.ts and main.ts into the corresponding files of a MakeCode project, or use the following link to download the MakeCode editor into a browser with this project's code already in place: [https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:_YzWa4u6AEfEz](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:_YzWa4u6AEfEz).
